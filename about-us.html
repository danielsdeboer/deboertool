					<h1>Technology</h1>
					<h2>It's our secret sauce.</h2>
					<p>Just look at it. We've got more <strong>inspection equipment</strong> than all other Canadian cutting tool houses combined. We don't buy used CNC machines: We sell outdated machinery to get the <strong>latest and greatest</strong>. We're committed to a philosophy of <strong>continual improvement</strong> and investment in technology.</p>
					<p>Want a tour of the plant? Drop by! We like to show off a bit. And if you can't make it, <a href="#">Here's a little video we made</a>. (It's seriously awesome! If you watch it more than once, we'll understand.)</p>

					<h1>Our People</h1>
					<h2>We can't make magic without magicians.</h2>
					<p>CNC cutter grinder programmers are a rare breed. It takes <strong>attention to detail</strong>, lots of learning... and, well, lots more learning. Without the right people, all we've got is a bunch of fancy equipment sitting around doing nothing.</p>
					<p>Since our inception we've done <strong>100% in-house training</strong>. We've developed a rigorous CNC cutter grinder training program. And the training doesn't stop! We demand continual improvement, not just in machinery and technology but in <strong>operator expertise</strong> too.</p>
					<p>Sound like something you want to do? Got a head chock-full of brains and want to use them? <a href="#">Check out our careers page</a>.</p>

					<h1>In The History</h1>
					<h2>Our Simarillion, somewhat abridged</h2>
					<p>In the early 1900s Opa de Boer left The Netherlands. This made a lot of people very happy and been widely regarded as a good move. He and his wife had several children. Several of them started businesses. This is one of those businesses.</p>
					<p>In 2007 we moved to our current location at 336 Watline Ave, which we're currently concentrating on growing out of far sooner than we'd expected.</p>
