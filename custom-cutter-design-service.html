				<h1>Technology</h1>
				<h2>It's our secret sauce.</h2>
				<p>Just look at it. We've got more <strong>inspection equipment</strong> than all other Canadian cutting tool houses combined. We don't buy used CNC machines: We sell outdated machinery to get the <strong>latest and greatest</strong>. We're committed to a philosophy of <strong>continual improvement</strong> and investment in technology.</p>

				<h1>Our People</h1>
				<h2>We can't make magic without magicians.</h2>
				<p>CNC cutter grinder programmers are a rare breed. It takes <strong>attention to detail</strong>, lots of learning... and, well, lots more learning. Without the right people, all we've got is a bunch of fancy equipment sitting around doing nothing.</p>
				<p>Since our inception we've done <strong>100% in-house training</strong>. We've developed a rigorous CNC cutter grinder training program. And the training doesn't stop! We demand continual improvement, not just in machinery and technology but in <strong>operator expertise</strong> too.</p>
